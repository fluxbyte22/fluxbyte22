I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for uncovering the stories hidden within data. My focus is on Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), where I apply the same discipline and endurance from my triathlon training to digital investigations. Just like in an Ironman, the race for information is about strategy, persistence, and pushing past the obvious to find what's hidden in plain sight.

### 🔭 What I'm Currently Focused On

-   **OSINT Methodologies:** Refining techniques for ethical information gathering and analysis.
-   **Digital Privacy & OpSec:** Exploring tools and practices for enhancing operational security in a digital world.
-   **Data Visualization:** Turning raw data into actionable intelligence through clear and concise visualizations.

### 🏊‍♀️ Fun Fact

When I'm not behind a screen, you can usually find me swimming, biking, or running. I'm a dedicated triathlete, having completed multiple 70.3 races and a full Ironman. The mental fortitude required to cross the finish line is the same energy I bring to every investigation.
